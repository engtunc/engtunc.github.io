  - "[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.       "
  - "Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.    "

  - "Some of the metadata is in the @Component decorators that you added to your component classes.  Other critical metadata is in @NgModule decorators.      "
  - "The most important @NgModule decorator annotates the top-level AppModule class.      "
  - "The Angular CLI generated an AppModule class in src/app/app.module.ts when it created the project.  This is where you opt-in to the FormsModule.    "

  - "import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; // <-- NgModel lives here"

  - "Edit the hero"
  - "Users should be able to edit the hero name in an <input> textbox.      "

  - "<div>    <label>name:      <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">    </label>  </div>"
  - "[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.       "
  - "Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.    "
  - "The missing FormsModule"
  - "Notice that the app stopped working when you added [(ngModel)].    To see the error, open the browser development tools and look in the console  for a message like  "
  - "Although ngModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default.     It belongs to the optional FormsModule and you must opt-in to using it.  "
  - "AppModule"
  - "Angular needs to know how the pieces of your application fit together  and what other files and libraries the app requires.  This information is called metadata      "
  - "Some of the metadata is in the @Component decorators that you added to your component classes.  Other critical metadata is in @NgModule decorators.      "
  - "The most important @NgModule decorator annotates the top-level AppModule class.      "
  - "The Angular CLI generated an AppModule class in src/app/app.module.ts when it created the project.  This is where you opt-in to the FormsModule.    "
